# PasswordInput.java 
- This program was designed to create a hash of a password. When entering the same password again it shows that the hash values equal each other. 

### Way to implement
- Use this program to create a hash for password which you can then store somewhere safely. Refer back to the stored hashes for passwords that you might have forgotten. Decrypt the encrypted password and figure out what the password was.
